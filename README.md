# rswift-plugin

Use R.swift for resources in your own Swift package.

### How ?

1. This is a plugin for Swift Package Manager, which supports plugins since Swift 5.6,
therefore the proper swift tools needs to be used

`// swift-tools-version:5.6`

2. You need two dependencies, `R.swift.Library` as usual, but also `R.swift.Plugin`

```
dependencies: [
  .package(
    url: "https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library.git",
    from: "5.4.0"
  ),
  .package(
    url: "https://github.com/maximkrouk/rswift-plugin.git", 
    from: "0.0.1"
  )
],
```
    
3. Your target needs to link with `R.swift.Library` and use the plugin

```
targets: [
  .target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
      .product(
        name: "Rswift",
        package: "R.swift.Library"
      )
    ],
    resources: [
      .process("Resources")
    ],
    plugins: [
      .plugin(
        name: "rswift-plugin", package: "rswift-plugin")]
      )
    ]
  )
]
```

4. Use R.swift like before :

  ```
let image = R.image.someImage()
```

### More...

This plugin may not be _bullet-proof_ since it was barely tested. It is awaiting to become officially supported by the official **R.swift**, here is what to know about how it works :

- The SPM plugin uses an executable variant of the official **R.swift**. It is currently hosted through a github release built from [this branch](https://github.com/quentinfasquel/R.swift/tree/feature/generate-swift-package-resources).

- It uses `--accessLevel public` so that the resources of a package, and mostly `R.validate()`, are accessible in the package's **test target**.

- The executable is slightly big (~ 24Mb) since it carries along a dependency on Swift Package Manager's own _package model_


- Your feedback is welcome!
